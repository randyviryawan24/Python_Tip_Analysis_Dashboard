#### Code:

``` python
#Data Preparation

sns.set_theme(style = 'whitegrid')
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize = (12,5))

hue_colors = {
    'Female':'Red',
    'Male':'Black'
}
total_bill = tips['total_bill']
tip = tips['tip']
male_total_bill = tips[tips['sex'] == 'Male']['total_bill']
male_tip = tips[tips['sex'] == 'Male']['tip']
female_total_bill = tips[tips['sex'] == 'Female']['total_bill']
female_tip = tips[tips['sex'] == 'Female']['tip']

#Person Correlation
overall_corr,_ = pearsonr(total_bill,tip)
male_corr,_ = pearsonr(male_total_bill,male_tip)
female_corr,_ = pearsonr(female_total_bill,female_tip)

#Scatter Plot
sns.scatterplot(
    data = tips, 
    x = 'total_bill',
    y = 'tip',

#### Insights: 
- **Line Plot:** Tips generally increase with bill size.
- **Scatter Plot**: 
  - Based on overall score **pearson correlation of 0.68**, there is **a moderate positive correlation** between **tips growth and total bill**. 
  - Breaking it down by **gender**, the results for both male and female show similarly **a moderate positive correlation.** 

### 2. ðŸ’¡ How does tipping differ by day of the week?
#### Chart: Relplot (kind = Line)

#### Code: 

```python

plt.tight_layout()
```
![Chart_8](docs/box_tips_pct_time_smoker.png)

#### Insights:
- Based on median **smokers** tip more during lunch time **(Lunch: 15.4% vs Dinner: 14.9%)** as opposed to **non-smokers (Lunch: 15.3% vs Dinner: 15.6%)** The average tipping percentage is similar between the groups, but **smokers** show a **higher variance**, indicating **less consistent** tipping behavior.

### 9. ðŸ’¡How does average tip percentage vary by day of the week and time of day?

#### Chart: Heatmap

#### Code:
```python
pivot = tips.pivot_table(
    index = 'day',
    columns='time',
    values='tips_pct',

plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Day')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
![Chart_9](docs/heatmap_tips_pct_time_day.png)
#### Insights: 
- The tips percentage across days are **nearly equal** except for **friday-lunch time** who stands out as the **highest median** tips percentage.

## Key takeaways
### 1. Correlation between total bill and tip
There is a **moderate positive correlation (r = 0.68) between total bill and tips**, meaning that as the total bill increases, the tip also tends to increase. This trend holds consistently across gender, day, and time.

### 2. Visitor distribution by day and time
Customers are more likely to visit on **weekends** (Saturday: 87 visits, Sunday: 76 visits) compared to **weekdays** (Thursday: 62, Friday: 19), even though the restaurant only opens for dinner on weekends. **Males** represent **64.3%** of total customers.

### 3. Spending and tipping behavior by gender 
Although **females spend less** on average than males ($18.06 vs. $20.74), they tend to **tip more** relative to the bill, as shown by the median values in the box plot. This pattern is particularly noticeable on **Fridays and Sundays**. **On Friday**, the median tip percentage for **females is 19.5%**, compared to **13.4% for males**. **On Sunday**, it's **16.9% for females and 15.8% for males.** 
The trend holds when looking at averages as well, with female tip percentages slightly higher: 19.9% vs. 14.3% on Friday, and 18.1% vs. 16.3% on Sunday.

### 4. Fridayâ€™s unusual tipping pattern 
Despite having the **fewest total visits (19), Friday** stands out with the **highest median tip percentage (18.8%)**, particularly at **lunch time**, where tipping behavior is significantly more generous than at dinner.

### 5. Smokers vs. non-smokers
Based on median **smokers** tip more during **lunch time** (Lunch: 15.4% vs Dinner: 14.9%) as opposed to non-smokers (Lunch: 15.3% vs Dinner: 15.6%) The average tipping percentage is **similar** between the groups, but **smokers show a higher variance**, indicating **less consistent** tipping behavior.

## T-Statistic Test

### ðŸ“Š 1. T-test Male vs Female on Tip_Pct

#### Code:
```python
# importing t-test
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

# Preparing the data
male = tips[tips['sex']=='Male']['tips_pct']
female = tips[tips['sex']=='Female']['tips_pct']

# Calculating the mean and number of samples
male_mean = round(male.mean()*100,2)
male_sample = male.count()
female_mean = round(female.mean()*100,2)
female_sample = female.count()

# implementing t-test
stats_test = ttest_ind(
    male,
    female,
    equal_var=False
)

print(f"male_mean = (n = {male_sample}) {male_mean}")
print(f"female_mean = (n = {female_sample}) {female_mean}")
print(f"T-statistic result = {stats_test.statistic}")
print(f"p-value = {stats_test.pvalue}")
print(f"Test type = Welchâ€™s t-test")
```

#### Summary of Results:
```
male_mean = (n = 157) 15.77
female_mean = (n = 87) 16.65
T-statistic result = -1.1432770167349968
p-value = 0.25424561889275826
Test type = Welchâ€™s t-test
```

#### ðŸ“Œ Interpretation:
- There is **no statistically significant difference** in tipping percentage between male and female customers.

- The p-value = 0.254 is greater than the conventional threshold of 0.05, so **we fail to reject the null hypothesis.**

- Although **females appear to tip slightly more on average (16.65% vs. 15.77%)**, this difference is not large enough to be considered statistically meaningful based on the sample observed.

p-value = 0.007085504975402716
Test type = Welchâ€™s t-test
```

#### ðŸ“Œ Interpretation:
- There is **a statistically significant difference** in tipping percentage between female and male customers visiting on Friday.

- The p-value = 0.007 is less than the conventional threshold of 0.05, **so we reject the null hypothesis.**

- **Female customers tip significantly more on average (19.94%) compared to male customers (14.34%) during Friday visits**, indicating a meaningful difference in tipping behavior between genders on that day.

## Conclusion

This analysis explored tipping behavior across multiple factors including **gender**, **time of day**, **day of week**, and **smoking status**. Statistical testing using Welchâ€™s t-tests provided a rigorous basis to evaluate observed patterns.

Overall, **most comparisons showed no statistically significant differences** in tipping percentages, indicating that **gender**, **meal time (lunch vs. dinner)**, **day type (weekday vs. weekend)**, and **smoking status** do not strongly influence tipping behavior in this dataset. For instance, average tipping percentages between males and females, lunch and dinner, and smokers and non-smokers were similar when accounting for statistical variation.

However, a notable exception was found in the comparison of **female and male customers visiting on Fridays**, where females tipped significantly more on average (**19.94% vs. 14.34%, p = 0.007**). This suggests a meaningful gender-related difference in tipping behavior specific to that day, which could be further explored for targeted marketing or service strategies.

Additionally, while **Friday lunch tipping appeared higher compared to other times**, this difference was **not statistically significant**, likely due to the small sample size.

Limitations of this study include the relatively small number of observations in certain subgroups, which may reduce the power to detect smaller effects. Future work with larger datasets or incorporating other factors (such as party size or server characteristics) may yield deeper insights.

In summary, the tipping patterns generally show consistency across groups with one key exception on **Friday visits by gender**. These findings can inform restaurant management and marketing efforts aiming to understand and potentially influence tipping behavior.
